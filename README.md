## Description
This simple Note Taker app is created using Express.js to allow a simple yet effective method of writing and saving notes.

Using the GET, DELETE and POST methods, the infomation (notes) added by the user are saved to the back end database, and then retrieved and saved in the left-hand column of the application. 

The user then has the option to delete these saved notes, or add as many as they'd like.
